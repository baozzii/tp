**Organi-zer** is a desktop application that **manages a database of organ donor recipients**.
It is intended for **organ donation coordinators** who require an **easy, fast, and efficient** way to
**navigate a database** and find the **right recipient**, during the **short time window** that an organ is available for donation.
